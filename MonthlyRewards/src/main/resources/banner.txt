 * This application is written for the Portals Platform team in Maryland Heights, MO,
 * as a homework assignment of sample code using Java, Spring Boot, REST
 * and various other relevant technologies as determined to express
 * skill in being able to write and present such working code.
 *
 *
 * A record of every transaction for a customer is provided for a three month period.
 * This module will then calculate the reward points earned and their totals for
 * each customer during that 3 month period.
 *
 * Note: In this demo we are using the H2 in memory database. Once this Spring application
 * has been started you may access the console @ http://localhost:8080/h2-console .
 * Just press the "Connect" Button then more data may be entered directly or viewed.
 *
 * Warning: Since this is using an in memory database once the application is stopped
 * all data will be removed and only the data inserted from the command line runner
 * will be inserted upon restart.
